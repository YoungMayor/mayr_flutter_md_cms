# 📜 Mayr Markdown CMS

*Fetch, Load, and Render Markdown — the Smart Way.*

`mayr_md_cms` is a powerful yet lightweight Flutter widget for fetching and displaying Markdown content from multiple sources:
- Local asset files 📂
- Network URLs 🌐
- Custom-defined futures ⚡

With built-in loading indicators, error handling, and smooth Markdown rendering, **mayr_md_cms** saves you from boilerplate and keeps your UI clean.

Whether you are building a blog, documentation app, or a CMS-driven mobile app, `mayr_md_cms` makes working with Markdown effortless!


## 🌟 Features
- Fetch and Render Markdown: Seamlessly fetch and display Markdown content from various sources like local assets, network URLs, or custom futures.

- Automatic Link Handling: Automatically handle link clicks within the Markdown:

  - Open valid URLs in the browser 🌐

  - Copy to clipboard for invalid links 📋

  - Option to let users define their custom link handling 🛠️

- Internal Link actions: Add custom internal links in your Markdown (e.g., `[About Us](internal:about_us)`), and map them to custom actions (e.g., `{'internal:about_us': (context) {...}}`). Clicking such links will run the custom actions provided

- Fully Customisable:

  - Modify the loading widget 🌀

  - Customise the error widget ⚠️

  - Change the Markdown stylesheet (colors, fonts, etc.) 🎨

- Extendable: Create your own custom Markdown CMS by extending the base class:
    ```dart
    class CustomMdCms extends MayrMdCms {}
    ```
    Define your own custom behavior, UI components, and logic.

- Built-in Loading and Error Handling: Graceful fallbacks for loading content and error states 🛠️

- Flexible Content Source: Fetch content from various sources like:

  - Local assets using fromLocal()

  - Network URLs using fromNetwork()

  - Custom async functions using custom()

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Add `mayr_md_cms` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        mayr_md_cms: # check for the latest version on pub.dev
    ```

2. Instal the package:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Import it into your Dart file:
    ```dart
    import 'package:mayr_md_cms/mayr_md_cms.dart';
    ```

    > Alternatively, you could install it using the command
    > ```bash
    > flutter pub add mayr_md_cms
    > ```


## 🚀 Usage

Here’s how to use MayrMdCms and display Markdown content in your Flutter app:

### 1. Import the Package
Import the package into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:mayr_md_cms/mayr_md_cms.dart';
```

### 2. Fetch and Display Content

#### From Local Asset:

If you have a Markdown file in your assets:

```dart
MayrMdCms.fromLocal(
  'assets/content.md',
  config: mayrMdCmsConfig // Config is optional
);

// More on the config later
```

#### From Network URL:

If you want to fetch the Markdown content from a URL:

```dart
MayrMdCms.fromNetwork(
  'https://example.com/content.md',
  config: mayrMdCmsConfig // Config is optional
  dioClient: dioClient, // Optional
);

// You could choose to pass your own instance of dio that would be used in getting the page.
// This is useful if for example authentication is required to access the page or extra dio configurations are needed
```

#### Using a Custom Future:

You can also pass a custom Future to fetch content, giving you full control over the data source:

```dart
MayrMdCms.custom(() async {
  // Custom async fetch logic
  return 'Your custom markdown content goes here';
});
```

### 3. Internal Actions on Links

To create internal navigation in your app, define internal links in your Markdown (e.g., `[About Us](internal:about_us)`), and map them to your custom widgets:

Internal actions and handlers can be used as below:

1. #### Define your internal actions on the config:
    ```dart
    MayrMdCms.fromNetwork(
      'https://example.com/content.md',
      config: MayrMdCmsConfig(
        internalActions: {
          "internal:action_one": (context) => print("Link One clicked"),
          "internal:action_two": (context) => print("Link two clicked"),
        },
      ),
    );
    ```

2. #### Add the links to your markdown
    ```markdown
    You could choose to perform [Action One](internal:action_one) or even [Action Two](internal:action_two)
    ```

Now when user clicks on any of the action links, the associated actions would be run

### 4. Extend the Package

For more control, you can create a custom class that extends MayrMdCms and override methods or add new logic:

```dart
class CustomMdCms extends MayrMdCms {
  @override
  MayrMdCmsConfig get config => MayrMdCmsConfig(
    loadingWidget: MyCustomLoadingWidget(),
    errorWidget: MyCustomErrorWidget(),
    emptyWidget: MyCustomEmptyWidget(),
    shrinkWrap: true,
    scrollPhysics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
    internalActions: {
      "internal:indicate_interest": (context) {...},
      "internal:go_to_signup": (context) => context.go("/signup"),
      "internal:switch_theme_dark": (context) => MyThemeSwitcher.toDark(),
    },
    markdownStyleSheet: MyCustomMarkdownStyleSheet()
  );
}
```

After the package has been extended, it can then be used as below:

```dart
CustomMdCms().local(...);
CustomMdCms().network(...);
CustomMdCms().custom(...);
```

## 🛠️  Configuration

Certain aspects of the package can be configured using the `MayrMdCmsConfig(...)` class. A sample configuration is:

```dart
MayrMdCmsConfig(
  loadingWidget: MyCustomLoadingWidget(),
  errorWidget: MyCustomErrorWidget(),
  emptyWidget: MyCustomEmptyWidget(),
  shrinkWrap: true,
  scrollPhysics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
  internalActions: {
    "internal:indicate_interest": (context) {...},
    "internal:go_to_signup": (context) => context.go("/signup"),
    "internal:switch_theme_dark": (context) => MyThemeSwitcher.toDark(),
  },
  markdownStyleSheet: MyCustomMarkdownStyleSheet()
)
```
